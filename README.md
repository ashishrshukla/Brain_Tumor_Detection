# Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning

# Abstract
A brain tumor is understood by the scientific community as the growth of abnormal cells in the brain, some of which can lead to cancer. The traditional method to detect brain tumors is nuclear magnetic resonance (MRI). Having the MRI images, information about the uncontrolled growth of tissue in the brain is identified. In several research articles, brain tumor detection is done through the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. When these systems are applied to MRI images, brain tumor prediction is done very quickly and greater accuracy helps to deliver treatment to patients. These predictions also help the radiologist to make quick decisions. In the proposed work, a set of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are applied in the detection of the presence of brain tumor, and its performance is analyzed through different metrics.

# Objective
To predict and localize brain tumors through image segmentation from the MRI dataset available in Kaggle

# Dataset
The images are split into two folders yes and no each containing images with and without brain tumors respectively. There are a total of 253 images. You can download the dataset from below Link:

# Methodology
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Build a CNN Model
5. Train and evaluate the model

# Result
In brain tumor classification using machine learning, we built a binary classifier to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images. We built our classifier using transfer learning and obtained an accuracy of 96.5% and visualized our modelâ€™s overall performance.
